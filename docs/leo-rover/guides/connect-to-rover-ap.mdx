To connect to Leo Rover, turn it on using its main power button located on the left side of the battery.
The LED on the button should start blinking green. After ca. 30 s the LED should stop blinking and the Rover
should be operational.

Check your host device for the WiFi network. The default credentials should look like this:

```
SSID: LeoRover-XXXX
Password: password
```

:::note
Instead of the XXXX keyword, you'll see an identifier unique to your Rover's computer.
