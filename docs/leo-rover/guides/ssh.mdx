Download and install Putty - it will allow you to establish SSH connection with the Rover and open
a terminal session.

Open Putty, type `10.0.0.1` as IP address and press Open.

You can safely ignore it and click the **Yes** button.

You'll see something like this. You're in!

## Using command line SSH client

If you are using Linux or Mac OS, you most likely have an SSH client already installed.
On Windows 10, you can use this guide to install OpenSSH.

To connect to your Rover, open a terminal session and type:

```bash
ssh pi@10.0.0.1
```

If you log in for the first time, you might see a similar message:

  alt="Terminal screen on the Linux"

  }}
/>

Type `yes` and press enter to continue.

When prompted for password, type: `raspberry`
