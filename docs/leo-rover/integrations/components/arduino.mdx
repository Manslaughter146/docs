In this tutorial, we'll show you how to connect Arduino to Leo Rover.

## What is Arduino?

Before we get started, let's say a few words about what Arduino actually is.

**Arduino** is an open-source electronic platform that allows users to easily
access advanced technologies interacting with the physical world.

### What do I need Arduino for?

You might wonder what the point of having Arduino inside Leo Rover is. After
all, isn't the robot already equipped with a Raspberry Pi micro-computer?

Well, the simplicity of Arduino makes it more convenient for typical hardware
projects. Arduino has analog capabilities that the Raspberry Pi lacks by
default. Its flexibility allows you to work with almost any type of sensor.

Arduino speeds up the creation of simple projects that don't require advanced
software and a good Internet connection.

Let's not forget that behind the name "Arduino" hide many boards, so if you want
to learn how to choose the best one for your project, look
[here](https://www.leorover.tech/post/how-to-choose-the-right-arduino-board).
For our projects, we mostly use **Arduino DUE**.

## What to expect?

Having finished the tutorial you'll know how to connect Arduino to the Leo Rover
and use its potential to further improve your projects and make the development
process of future projects a little bit faster.

## List of components

- Any Arduino ( or any other compatible board)
- Any way of connecting the board to the rover
- USB cable

## Mechanical integration

We have created mechanical interfaces for Arduino DUE, which you can get here:

<LinkButton

  description="Addon adapters / Arduino Due"
/>

You'll need to press in ten M3, threaded heat-set inserts into the base part.
This allows you to use M3x6 Allen screws to hold the Arduino securely. The cover
is held by 4 screws of the same size.

Since Arduino Due has the largest footprint out of all the Arduino boards it
should be pretty easy to adapt the provided Arduino DUE adapter models to fit
other boards inside. All you need to do is use 3D CAD program like **Autodesk
Fusion** to change the way mounting holes for the board are positioned.

## Wiring and electronics connection

For most intents and purposes the only connection you need to provide is an USB
connection between the board and the USB port at the top of the rover. However,
you may want to provide the microcontroller, and the sensors that you are using,
with external power source. For such cases powerbox addon might be a good
choice.

## Software integration

There are several ways to integrate Arduino into the rover. From this tutorial,
you'll learn about two of them so that you can decide which one works best for
you.

      This way saves you from having to dive into the rover's insides. It works;
      however, it does not allow you to communicate between the rover's onboard
      computer and Arduino - this, in turn, makes it harder to use the data
      harvested by any sensors connected to the Arduino.

    First, install Arduino IDE using any of those provided tutorials:

    - [Arduino IDE installation and setup (Windows)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)
    - [Arduino IDE installation and setup (Linux)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux)

    Then, you need to set up Arduino IDE (we're using Arduino DUE which needs a special configuration in Arduino IDE).

    To do so, do as follows: while in IDE, go to: **Tools** -> **Board** -> **Boards Manager**

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-board-manager.webp"
      width="954"
      height="515"
    />

    Type “DUE” in the search bar and install the latest version of `Arduino SAM Boards` (32-bits ARM Cortex-M3).

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-board-manager-due.webp"
      width="976"
      height="224"
    />

    The next step is to take care of the board specific setup:

    - Connect the board to a USB port in your computer (use the port closer to the barrel jack socket)
    - Go to: **Tools** -> **Board** -> **Arduino ARM (32-bits) Boards** and choose **Arduino Due (Programming Port)**

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-programming-port.webp"
      width="955"
      height="515"
    />

    - Go to: **Tools** -> **Port** and choose the port Arduino is connected to

    <ImageZoom
      src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-programming-port-2.webp"
      width="955"
      height="515"
    />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="software-eng" label="Software engineer way"></TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Checking setup

The easiest way to check if the board is working, is to use pre-created example
codes. One of them is the blink sketch provided in the Arduino IDE examples.

Go to: **File** -> **Examples** -> **01.Basics** and choose the **Blink** sketch

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-blink.webp"
  width="956"
  height="513"
/>

You should see something similar to this:

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-blink-code.webp"
  width="956"
  height="1035"
/>

Now, you'll have to verify the code and send it to the board. First, make sure
the correct board and ports are chosen as shown below:

  width="638"
  height="428"
  figStyle={{
    width: 500,
  }}
/>

Now you can **verify(1)** and **upload(2)** the code.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/integrations/arduino/arduino-verify-upload.webp"
  width="238"
  height="157"
  figStyle={{
    width: 250,
  }}
/>

After a few seconds, you should see two things:

- the following statement:

  }}
/>

- and Arduino's built-in LED blinking
