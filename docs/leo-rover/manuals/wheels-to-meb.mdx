## Step 1: Wheels to frame

Prepare:

- 4x Task 1 assembly
- Task 6 assembly
- 8x M5x10 torx screws
- 5mm hex-head key

## Step 2: Wheel cable routing

Prepare:

- Step 1 assembly

    (the one closer to the wheel)."

  caption="Grab the white rubber seal and press it through the hole.
    It should lie flat at the side of the box when you are done with it."

<ImageZoom

  caption="You can pull most of the cable inside the electronics box.
    Leave just enough slack for the cable to be able to hide in the v-slot groove.
    This will help with securing the cable later."
/>

  caption="Do the same thing with the front wheel, this time pulling the cable through
    the second hole. Again, leave enough slack for the cable to hide in the groove."
/>

## Step 3: Securing the cables

Prepare:

- Step 2 assembly
- pack of small zip-ties
- pack of big zip-ties

<ImageZoom src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/manuals/wheels-to-meb/wheels-to-meb-18.webp" />

<ImageZoom

  caption="There are holes designated to be used for holding the cable securely in
    every wheel mount. For each of the 4 wheels grab the cable with 2 zip-ties."

  caption="Grab the plastic cable clips and separate them
    (remove the small circular parts from the ends of the stick as well)."
/>

<ImageZoom

  caption="Secure the cables in the v-slot grooves by pressing a clip into them.
    Some force might be needed as the clips were designed to hold the cables as firmly
    as possible."

  caption="Remember to secure the the back wheel cable as well."

## Step 4: Connecting the wheels

Prepare:

- Step 3 assembly

<ImageZoom src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/manuals/wheels-to-meb/wheels-to-meb-25.webp" />

<ImageZoom src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/manuals/wheels-to-meb/wheels-to-meb-25.webp" />

<ImageZoom

  caption="Grab the cable with shorter length protruding into the MEB
    (the one for the front wheel) and press its connector into the blue socket
    on the LeoCore (the one closer to the front of the rover)."
/>

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/manuals/wheels-to-meb/wheels-to-meb-27.webp"
  caption="You can do an analogous operation for the longer cable."
/>

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/manuals/wheels-to-meb/wheels-to-meb-28.webp"
  caption="If you want to keep the MEB looking a little bit cleaner,
    you can pull the cable under the 3D printed electronics cover first."
/>

<ImageZoom src="/img/docs_images/leo-rover/manuals/wheels-to-meb/wheels-to-meb-29.webp" />

<ImageZoom

  caption="Repeat the same operations for the other side of the rover and you are done.
    There should be some leftover zip-ties from previous tasks which you can use to
    further improve the cable management."
